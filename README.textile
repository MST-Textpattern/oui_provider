h2. Extension creation

A provider related extension can be created as a Textpattern plugin by using a class named like the new provider and extending either @Oui\Player\Embed@ or its child @Oui\Player\OEmbed@ in a plugin author prefix related namespace (e.g. @namespace Oui;@).
Once the class created, in most cases, it should only require to override some static properties.
